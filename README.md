# Personal Website

This website is built using vibe coding with the help of thinking-Claude, Windsurf + Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Grok. I'm proud to say that I wrote 0 lines of code for this repo (I know, I know, it's a feat).

I have almost zero front-end development experience, and this website took me less than two days to build. Pretty impressive, right? 


### My thoughts on Vibe Coding

**Best Models**

* Building from Scratch: Claude 3.7 Sonnet > ChatGPT (Reasoning) > Gemini 2.0 (Flash Thinking)

* Debugging: Grok (Reasoning) > Claude (Thinking) > ChatGPT (Reasoning) > Gemini 2.0 (Flash Thinking)

**Tips**

* Version Control: Always save your code whenever you reach a stable version. LLMs can sometimes hallucinate and corrupt your progress.

* Managing Large Codebases: As your project grows, LLMs may struggle to grasp the entire codebase. Instead: Develop a basic understanding of the codebase; Identify and provide only the relevant sections to the LLM to avoid overwhelming it with unrelated content.

* Start Simple: For example, begin with a single-page design. Once the structure is clear, ask the LLM to split the content into multiple files and languages for better organization.

* Traditional Chinese Parsing: LLMs often struggle with Traditional Chinese text. For better results:
Separate translation tasks from website-building tasks.

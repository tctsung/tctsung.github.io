## Personal Portfolio

A minimalist, React-based personal website built entirely through vibe coding.
I operated in a Copilot-style workflow, providing clear instructions on frontend/backend design while AI generated the implementation.

Check [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md) for the well-designed system prompt used to control the AI's output, UI guidelines, tech stack (React, Vite, Framer Motion), and the data-driven architecture (JSON and Markdown)


## AI Models Used

- Version 1: thinking-Claude, Windsurf + Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Grok

- Version 2: Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 Pro

## Run Locally

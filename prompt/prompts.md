Here are some records of the prompt I used to build this website.



### Zero to One

I provide some basic requirements for the website, the color palette, and the placeholder files path.

```txt
I have created a GitHub repository called tctsung.github.io. Please help me build a personal website using GitHub Pages. Follow these requirements:  
### General Structure
- Implement a frozen (sticky) header with links to the following sections:
  - About
  - Resume
  - Blog
  - Projects
- The homepage should default to the "About" section, designed to resemble a name card with a brief summary.

### Design Details
- Include a personal picture in a circular shape using the placeholder image path: img/me.jpg.
- Use the following color palette as the primary theme:
  - Soft pink: #F7CFD8
  - Light yellow: #F4F8D3
  - Mint green: #A6F1E0
  - Teal blue: #73C7C7

### Additional Notes
- Prioritize clean, modern design with intuitive navigation.
- Ensure the layout is responsive for both desktop and mobile users.
Please provide the full HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to meet these requirements. Comment your code clearly to explain key elements and styling choices.
